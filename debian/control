Description: computer algebra algorithms for solving polynomial systems
 msolve is an open source C library implementing computer algebra
 algorithms for solving polynomial systems (with rational coefficients
 or coefficients in a prime field).
 .
 Currently, with msolve, you can basically solve multivariate
 polynomial systems. This encompasses:
 .
  * the computation of Groebner bases
  * real root isolation of the solutions to polynomial systems
  * the computation of the dimension and the degree of the solution set
  * and many other things you can do using msolve.
 .
 This package contains the command line interface and documentation.
