Description: library for solving multivariate polynomial systems.
 msolve is a C library for solving multivariate polynomial systems of
 equations. It relies on computer algebra, a.k.a. symbolic computation,
 algorithms to compute algebraic representations of the solution set
 from which many, if not all, informations can be extracted.  Solving
 polynomial systems with msolve is global by contrast to local
 numerical routines.  The use of computer algebra methods allow also
 the user to bypass classical numerical issues encountered by numerical
 methods for polynomial system solving.  msolve relies mainly on
 Gr√∂bner bases algorithms (see below for a some basic definitions and
 properties). It is highly optimized, uses AVX2 vectorization
 instructions and multi-threading.
 .
 It uses the GMP library (handling multi-precision integers) and the
 FLINT library (handling arithmetics of univariate polynomials).
